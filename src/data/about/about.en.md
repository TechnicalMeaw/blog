title: "About"

I’m **Santanu Mukherjee**, a software engineer focused on building **production-grade mobile and backend systems**.

I work primarily with **Flutter** on the client side and design **scalable backend architectures** using cloud services, event-driven systems, and relational data models. My work is driven by performance, maintainability, and long-term scalability — not just getting things to work.

This blog is a place where I write about:

- real-world engineering decisions
- system architecture and trade-offs
- performance bottlenecks and optimizations
- lessons learned from building and shipping products

Most articles here are based on **hands-on experience**, not tutorials rewritten from documentation.

## Background

Over the years, I’ve worked on:

- cross-platform Flutter applications (mobile & web)
- backend systems handling real production traffic
- cloud-native workflows using AWS, serverless functions, and managed databases
- data modeling and search for complex systems like email platforms

I care deeply about **clean architecture**, but I’m equally opinionated about _when not to over-engineer_.

## Tech I Work With

While tools change, these are some I regularly use:

- Flutter, Dart
- Kotlin, Python
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase (when it fits)
- AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, etc.)

I choose tools based on **context and constraints**, not trends.

## About This Blog

This blog is intentionally minimal.

There are no pop-ups, trackers, or growth hacks.  
Just long-form writing, focused on clarity and depth.

If something here helps you think differently about a problem — it has done its job.
